# Etch-a-Sketch
Project: Etch-a-Sketch (The Odin Project)

Introduction
In this project, you’ll be creating a pretty neat toy to flex your DOM manipulation skills. You’re going to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

Assignment
1)Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
Create the divs using JavaScript. Don’t try to create them by hand by copying and pasting them in your HTML file!
It’s best to put your grid squares inside a “container” div. This div can be written in your HTML file.
Use Flexbox to make the divs appear as a grid (versus just one on each line). Despite the name, do not be tempted to research or use CSS Grid,
as it will be taught in a later lesson after the foundations path. This project is an opportunity specifically to practice Flexbox!

2)Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them,
leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.

3)Add a button on the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered,
the existing grid should be removed, and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g., 960px wide) so that you’ve got a new sketch pad.
